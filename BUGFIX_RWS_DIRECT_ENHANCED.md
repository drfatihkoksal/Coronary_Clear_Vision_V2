# RWS Button Direct Enhanced Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue
When clicking RWS analysis button, a choice dialog appeared asking to choose between "Standard" and "Enhanced" RWS methods. The Standard RWS method was non-functional, but users had to manually select Enhanced each time.

## Solution
Modified RWS button behavior to directly open Enhanced RWS analysis without showing the choice dialog.

## Files Changed

### `/src/ui/qca_widget.py`

#### 1. Modified `perform_rws_analysis()` method (line 1607):
**Before:**
```python
def perform_rws_analysis(self):
    """Perform RWS analysis on sequential QCA results"""
    # ... validation code ...
    
    # Ask user which analysis method to use
    choice = QMessageBox.question(self, "RWS Analysis Method",
                                "Choose RWS analysis method:\n\n"
                                "Standard: Uses MLD-based RWS calculation\n"
                                "Enhanced: Uses full vessel profile with motion artifact detection\n\n"
                                "Use Enhanced method?",
                                QMessageBox.StandardButton.Yes | QMessageBox.StandardButton.No | QMessageBox.StandardButton.Cancel)
    
    if choice == QMessageBox.StandardButton.Cancel:
        return
    
    if choice == QMessageBox.StandardButton.Yes:
        # Use enhanced RWS analysis
        self._perform_enhanced_rws_analysis(main_window)
    else:
        # Use standard RWS analysis
        self._perform_standard_rws_analysis(main_window)
```

**After:**
```python
def perform_rws_analysis(self):
    """Perform Enhanced RWS analysis on sequential QCA results"""
    logger.info("=== STARTING ENHANCED RWS ANALYSIS ===")
    # ... validation code ...
    
    # Directly use Enhanced RWS analysis (skip the choice dialog)
    logger.info("Using Enhanced RWS analysis with motion artifact detection")
    self._perform_enhanced_rws_analysis(main_window)
```

#### 2. Modified legacy `rws_analyze()` method (line 797):
**Before:** 
- Long function with standard RWS analysis implementation (~100 lines)

**After:**
```python
def rws_analyze(self):
    """Perform Enhanced RWS (Radial Wall Strain) analysis - redirects to enhanced method"""
    logger.info("Legacy RWS method called - redirecting to Enhanced RWS Analysis")
    
    try:
        # Check calibration first
        if not self.calibration_factor:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "No Calibration",
                              "Please perform calibration first.")
            return
        
        # Redirect to enhanced RWS analysis
        self.perform_rws_analysis()
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"RWS analysis error: {e}")
        QMessageBox.critical(self, "RWS Analysis Error", str(e))
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No more choice dialog - direct access to working RWS analysis
2. **Simplified Workflow**: Users don't need to know about Standard vs Enhanced - they get the best method automatically
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Both RWS entry points (`rws_analyze()` and `perform_rws_analysis()`) now use Enhanced method
4. **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminates non-functional Standard RWS option

## Technical Details

- **Enhanced RWS Features**:
  - Full vessel profile analysis
  - Motion artifact detection  
  - Improved accuracy over standard MLD-based calculation
  - Works with or without cardiac phase data

- **Backward Compatibility**: 
  - Kept `_perform_standard_rws_analysis()` method for potential future use
  - Legacy `rws_analyze()` method redirects to new implementation

## Testing Needed

User should verify:
1. Click RWS analysis button
2. Enhanced RWS dialog opens directly (no choice dialog)
3. RWS analysis completes successfully
4. Results are displayed properly

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

RWS analysis button now opens Enhanced RWS directly without showing the method selection dialog.
