# RWS Auto-Start Fix - Enhanced RWS Analysis

## Issue
When clicking RWS analysis button, Enhanced RWS dialog opened but analysis did not start automatically. Users had to manually click the "Analyze RWS" button inside the Enhanced RWS dialog to start analysis.

## Root Cause
The Enhanced RWS workflow was:
1. User clicks RWS button
2. Enhanced RWS dialog opens
3. User sees dialog with "Analyze RWS" button
4. User manually clicks "Analyze RWS" button 
5. Analysis starts

This extra manual step made it seem "non-functional" to users.

## Solution
Modified the Enhanced RWS dialog to automatically start analysis after dialog opens, eliminating the need for users to click the "Analyze RWS" button manually.

## Files Changed

### `/src/ui/qca_widget.py`

#### 1. Added QTimer import (line 11):
```python
from PyQt6.QtCore import Qt, pyqtSignal, QThread, pyqtSlot, QTimer
```

#### 2. Modified `_perform_enhanced_rws_analysis()` method (line 1714-1719):

**Before:**
```python
rws_widget.analysis_requested.connect(start_analysis)

dialog.exec()
```

**After:**
```python
rws_widget.analysis_requested.connect(start_analysis)

# Auto-start analysis immediately after dialog opens
QTimer.singleShot(100, start_analysis)  # Small delay to ensure dialog is fully loaded

dialog.exec()
```

## How it Works

1. **Dialog Setup**: Enhanced RWS dialog is created and configured
2. **Signal Connection**: `analysis_requested` signal is connected to `start_analysis` function
3. **Auto-Start**: `QTimer.singleShot(100, start_analysis)` automatically triggers analysis after 100ms
4. **Dialog Display**: Dialog opens and analysis starts automatically

The 100ms delay ensures the dialog is fully rendered before starting analysis.

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience**: RWS analysis starts immediately when dialog opens
2. **No Manual Interaction**: Users don't need to click additional buttons  
3. **Consistent Behavior**: RWS button now provides one-click analysis
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing Enhanced RWS features preserved

## User Experience

**Before**: 
- Click RWS button → Dialog opens → Click "Analyze RWS" → Analysis starts

**After**:
- Click RWS button → Dialog opens → Analysis starts automatically

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Enhanced RWS analysis now auto-starts when the dialog opens, providing a seamless one-click RWS analysis experience.
